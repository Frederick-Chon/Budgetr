# Budgetr

Budgetr is a an income/expense tracker that allows users to add transactions as income or expenses before a balance is calculated. Users will be presented with a history of previous transactions as well as an input form for users to describe the transaction along with the amount. This project focused on using higher order array methods such as filter, reduce and map to manipulate the inputs before persisting data in localStorage.
